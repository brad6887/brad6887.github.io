# Quoted Language Observation

The full-corpus discovery backlog identified quoted language as the strongest
new direction. Two independent batches noticed quotation marks being used for
emphasis, outside quotation, or comic framing.

The targeted review began by defining the complete search space. The source
CSV contains 3,039 reviewed rows, but only 1,342 belong to the actual discovery
population after eligibility and platform-context filtering. A first scan
accidentally included ordinary curly apostrophes such as the mark in “don’t.”
The detector was corrected to require paired quotation marks.

The final deterministic set contains 165 quote-bearing posts.

Those posts include several clearly different functions: song and movie
titles, direct attributed quotations, overheard speech, copied material,
skeptical labels, invented names, literal reinterpretations, and quoted claims
used to set up reversals.

The characteristic is therefore not “uses quotation marks.” The stronger and
more limited observation is that quotation marks sometimes create distance
from literal wording. A term can be treated as doubtful, renamed, or turned
into the target of a punchline.

Examples of that construction appear from the earliest Facebook periods
through much later writing. The review also retained ordinary titles and
direct quotations as boundary examples.

The local AI worker was asked to classify all 165 candidates. It failed twice:
the explanatory format exhausted its generation budget, and the compact
format replaced required identifiers with an ellipsis. Neither result was
accepted. This was a useful reminder that plausible partial output is not a
complete review.

The deterministic candidate set and explicit human source review were enough
to justify a draft observation:

```text
OBS-004 - Quoted Language as Comic Framing
```

It remains intentionally incomplete. There is no evidence, hypothesis, or
validation artifact yet. The next research step is to complete the functional
classification, decide whether distancing, renaming, and reversal belong
together, and only then select evidence.
