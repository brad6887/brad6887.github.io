# Abbey Root Status Utility and Content Pipeline

Date: 2026-06-28

## Summary

Today I added the first version of `abbey-status`, a command-line status utility for the Abbey Root lab.

I also started the BradCooke.com content source structure inside the repository.

## What Changed

- Created `tools/abbey-status`
- Updated `abbey-help`
- Added `abbey-status` to the typical workflow
- Verified Ansible inventory connectivity
- Added the top-level `content/` directory
- Added initial content documentation
- Created the Abbey Root content area

## Why It Matters

`abbey-status` gives the project a simple operational check that can be run at the start of a work session.

The `content/` directory begins the transition from only building infrastructure to using the infrastructure to produce website content.

## Lessons Learned

- Ansible commands need to run from the `ansible/` directory so they pick up `ansible.cfg`.
- `printf` is useful for producing clean command-line help output.
- Small helper tools make the lab easier to use and maintain.
- The website content pipeline should start with Markdown before choosing a site generator.

## Next Steps

- Improve `abbey-status` output formatting
- Add Docker container checks
- Add more Abbey Root journal entries
- Begin converting lab progress into BradCooke.com content
- Decide on the first website generator experiment
