# Voice Analysis Artifact Framework

## Summary

Expanded the Voice Analysis project from individual research outputs into a reusable research artifact framework.

The session focused on defining how research artifacts are identified, related, validated, and traced throughout the analysis lifecycle.

## Work Completed

Created the foundation for a research artifact model:

- Added artifact type definitions covering:
  - Corpus
  - Experiment
  - Observation
  - Evidence
  - Hypothesis
  - Validation
  - Voice Model
  - Derived Output

- Added artifact metadata standards defining:
  - Stable artifact identifiers
  - Artifact types
  - Versions
  - Lifecycle status
  - Provenance
  - Creation metadata
  - AI assistance metadata
  - Validation metadata

- Added the research artifact model describing common requirements shared across artifact types.

## Design Direction

The Voice Analysis framework now treats research outputs as connected artifacts rather than isolated documents.

The intended research chain is:

Raw Source Material

    ↓

Corpus

    ↓

Observation

    ↓

Evidence

    ↓

Hypothesis

    ↓

Validation

    ↓

Voice Model

    ↓

Derived Outputs

Each stage should preserve traceability to the artifacts that produced it.

## Lessons Learned

Creating reproducible research requires more than defining analysis methods. The artifacts produced by the methodology also need consistent identity, metadata, and relationships.

During implementation, markdown transport issues highlighted the importance of preserving artifact content exactly. Future automation should treat research artifacts as files with integrity requirements rather than formatted conversation output.

## Future Considerations

Potential future improvements:

- Artifact indexing
- Dependency tracking between research artifacts
- Automated validation
- Research dashboards
- AI-assisted artifact workflows

The artifact framework provides a foundation for scaling Voice Analysis beyond a single case study.
