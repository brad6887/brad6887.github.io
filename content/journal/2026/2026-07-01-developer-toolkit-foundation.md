# Abbey Root Status
Date: 2026-07-01

## Major Accomplishments

### Developer Toolkit

- Standardized the Abbey Root command-line toolkit.
- Converted operational commands into standalone tools under `tools/`.
- Removed duplicate shell function implementations.
- Standardized `--help` support across all tools.
- Made tools self-contained by automatically locating the repository root.
- Added Git synchronization helper.
- Standardized Ansible wrapper tools.
- Validated the toolkit on both `ubuntu-dev01` and `rocky-ansible01`.

### Ansible

- Converted update and facts playbooks into reusable Ansible roles.
- Added role defaults to eliminate hidden dependencies.
- Refactored Homepage role to be self-contained.
- Refactored Labtest role to use role defaults.
- Successfully completed a full `abbey-ansible-site` deployment after refactoring.

### Documentation

- Expanded automatic command documentation generation.
- Improved command metadata consistency.
- Continued reducing manually maintained documentation.
- Cleaned up legacy helper scripts and duplicate implementations.

### Architecture

- Established executable tools as the single source of truth for developer commands.
- Standardized repository path discovery across all toolkit commands.
- Continued moving configuration and behavior into reusable Ansible roles.
- Further advanced the project's self-documenting architecture.

## Lessons Learned

- Self-contained tools are more reliable than relying on environment variables.
- Every operational command should have a single implementation.
- Role defaults greatly reduce hidden dependencies and improve portability.
- Standardization requires patience but significantly reduces long-term maintenance.
- Testing across multiple systems uncovers inconsistencies that are easy to overlook during development.

## Next Session

- Auto-generate `abbey-help` from tool metadata.
- Continue BradCooke.com development.
- Expand Astro layouts and components.
- Continue evolving the project-aware developer environment.
- Design `abbey-doctor` as a self-validating toolkit command.
