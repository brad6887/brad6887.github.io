# Plant Workspace Onboarding Command

## Summary

Rocky Raccoon gave me the real example I needed to finish the plant onboarding
workflow. Instead of manually copying the reusable template and hoping every
field and directory was handled correctly, I can now create a canonical plant
workspace with one Abbey command and get an immediate validation result.

## Accomplishments

- Added `abbey plant new` with required plant identity and optional status, date, and initial photos.
- Made creation atomic and non-overwriting so a failed onboarding cannot leave a partial workspace.
- Kept unknown botanical, care, source, and location facts explicit instead of guessing.
- Added focused regression coverage for the successful workflow and its safety boundaries.
- Created and validated Rocky Raccoon's workspace through the finished command.
- Used Rocky's real onboarding to add adjacent-XMP import and warnings for untouched scaffold content.

## Lessons Learned

- A template can remain the source of structure without copying its instructional files into every real workspace.
- The first real use case is where a command contract becomes concrete: identity and structure belong in onboarding, while richer photo metadata and publication remain later workflows.
- Validation warnings are useful at onboarding time. Rocky Raccoon is structurally valid, while the missing transferred photograph remains visible work rather than hidden debt.
- A real run caught what fixture-only validation missed: preserving a photo means preserving its adjacent metadata, and existing files can still be unfinished templates.

## Next Steps

- Add Rocky Raccoon's real photographs and verified plant-specific story, history, inventory, and photo metadata before publication.
